# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17


## Overview of the analysis: The aim of this analysis is to use different machine learning models to predict credit risk of loan application data. 
We have applied these models to assess the different accuracy results and to determine the most useful model when it comes to predicting whether someone is low 
or high risk.


Results: Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.

Accuracy: 0.6416
Precision: 0.99
Recall: 0.65





Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
